## Images:
### Dashboard Tab (Light Mode):
The dashboard tab provides an "at a glance" display of information for the user. From here, the user can click on the "Budget" card to set the budget limit for the month, create new transactions, and view a range of data for that month, including Income, Expenses, Planned Expenses, and Net Cash Flow. The user can also see their current balance.

### Transactions Tab (Light Mode):
The Transactions tab displays the user's transactions. The user can select the month and year they wish to view, and see the transactions made in that month. It also displays upcoming transactions that are yet to be made. The user can select a transaction from the list to view more details, edit it, or delete the transaction.

### Recurring Transactions Tab (Light Mode):
The Recurring Transactions tab displays the transactions that the user has made that repeat at regular intervals. Similar to the Transactions tab, the user can select a transaction from the list to view more details or delete only future instances, or delete all instances. (Currently, it is not possible to edit a recurring transaction from this menu.)
